Roy

Chapter One: Clarity
 

The Old Hero sat in the ruin of a hall that had once echoed with feasts and laughter, now empty but for dust and the occasional rat. His hands, curled around a chipped goblet, were gnarled like ancient roots, his scars faded to whispers upon his skin. Somewhere beyond the crumbling walls, the world carried on--kings rose, empires fell, new monsters prowled--but he, once a name to be feared or cheered, had fallen into the quiet of memory.

Had he ever truly been what the songs claimed? The dragons, yes, he remembered fire and blood, but how many had truly needed slaying? And the princesses, the fair ladies who wept or waited--had they been saved? Or had they merely played their parts until they saw him for what he was: another wandering fool with a sword and a story? They had all left, every one. Had they escaped him? Had they simply tired of waiting for a hero to be something more?

He laughed, dry as old parchment. Perhaps he had been nothing but a dreamer after all, spinning glory from moldy bread and too much wine.

And yet.

The road still lay beyond the threshold. The wind still whispered of things unknown. He might be a fool, a failure, a relic--but he was not yet a corpse. And until he was, there was still the question, unanswered: what if, this time, I walk a different path?

He pushed himself to his feet, feeling the weight of years settle over his shoulders. The goblet clattered to the ground. He left it there. There was no need for old wine where he was going.
Chapter Two: The Measure of a Last Adventure

The Old Hero stood at the edge of the forest, watching the road curl away like a forgotten promise. His joints ached with the weight of years, but his mind, though weathered, still burned with restless fire. There was work yet to be done--he could feel it like an itch beneath his skin--but what shape it should take, and whether he was still worthy of it, he did not know.

Not all had been lost. He had gained something in his years of wandering, something beyond swordplay and war. The magic had come slowly, creeping into his bones like a patient vine--first a whisper of gold conjured from empty air, then the voices of birds unfolding into words, then visions flickering in puddles and glass. His most prized trick, the one that made him laugh despite himself, was his ability to walk between raindrops--not untouched, but aware of the space between them, the way the world curved around intention. And more than all this, he had learned to sense the Immanence of God, the deep hum beneath all things, the thread that bound the world together.

But magic was not enough. What he lacked was certainty. Once, he had been a man of instinct--see the beast, strike it down; find the maiden, free her. The world had been simple then, or so he had thought. But now, standing at the threshold of his final act, he knew he could not afford another folly. He had no time left for foolish quests or well-meant blunders.

He needed a plan.

He closed his eyes and splayed his calloused fingers over the cool surface of the road. He whispered a question to the earth, a habit born of both wisdom and superstition. What is left for me to do?

The wind shifted. The leaves stirred. And somewhere, distant but distinct, a voice--perhaps real, perhaps only his own longing--whispered:

“Find what was lost.” 

His eyes opened. He exhaled slowly.

Very well, then. One last adventure. But first, he must learn what had been lost, and where to seek it.
Chapter Three: The Ritual of Renewal

Before venturing into mysteries, the Old Hero attended to the mundane with a reverence usually reserved for sacred rites. First, he set to work on his trusted sword--its edge dulled by countless battles--sharpening it until it gleamed with a promise of renewed purpose. He polished the metal until it caught the light like a sliver of destiny. Then came the simple, yet vital, acts of self-care: a shave and haircut that stripped away the wild tangles of his past, and a cleansing bath in a cool, murmuring creek that washed away the dust and echoes of long-forgotten wars. In these acts, he found a subtle symbol of rebirth--a shedding of old scars in preparation for what lay ahead.

With his sword honed and his body renewed, he turned his eyes toward the nearby mountain, its peak a hazy sentinel against the sky. “Just exactly where am I?” he mused, a wry smile tugging at his lips as if the question itself were a challenge to fate. He began the arduous climb, each step an invocation of the ancient Eastern mental disciplines he had painstakingly learned over the years. His mind stretched, seeking the eight corners of the universe as if to capture its hidden truths. In the quiet, suspended moments of meditation, he summoned visions--first the disciplined, ephemeral insights of focused contemplation, and if those faltered, the unreliable yet oddly comforting guidance of moldy rye bread dreams.

But even as he searched inward and upward, a nagging thought remained: without a proper plan, without certainty, even magic could falter. Perhaps somewhere along the jagged paths of the mountain, a teacher awaited--a kindred spirit with wisdom both practical and profound, ready to help him decipher the elusive language of visions. For now, the climb itself was a rite, a passage from the known to the unknown, a deliberate step into the realm where the tangible met the mystical, and where the journey of renewal promised both peril and possibility.
Chapter Four: The Crow and the Princess

By the time he reached the peak, the Old Hero was scraped and exhausted, his hands raw from clinging to the unforgiving stone. The final ascent had been treacherous--nearly vertical, every handhold a wager against gravity--but now, standing at the summit, he let himself drink in the vastness below. The valley stretched endlessly toward the shimmering bay, where the ocean lay quiet under the afternoon sun.

He ate the last of his moldy rye, chewing thoughtfully as he watched the hawks wheel and dip between the ridges, their sharp eyes scanning the earth below. Hunters, he thought. Always hungry. Always seeking. The lesson was not lost on him.

As the sun slipped below the horizon, he built a small wall of stone to block the cold wind that poured down from the northern peaks. Wrapping himself tightly in his cloak, he let exhaustion pull him into sleep.

And then, the dream.

A crow landed beside him with a raucous cry. “Caw caw caw, caw!” it announced, full of arrogant certainty. This is mine! I am ruler of this mountain and everything that can be seen!

With a sharp breath, he woke. But it was no crow that stood before him.

The woman's presence struck him like a blow. She was tall and fierce, her black hair flowing down to her waist, the moonlight glinting off her sharp, dark eyes. Her cloak shimmered like raven's feathers, and the cold mountain wind swirled around her as though it obeyed her will.

Tamalpais.

The name rose unbidden in his mind, though he had never seen her before. Princess. Goddess. Ghost. She was all these things and none.

She stared down at him, and her gaze seemed to pierce his very heart.

“You stand on my mountain,” she said at last, her voice low and edged like a knife. “Tell me, Old Hero--why have you come?”
Chapter Five: The Ruler of the Heights

“Your Highness,” he pronounced with awe and reverence, and bowed low, removing his hat.

“It is true that I am old. Hero? Perhaps once I rescued a kitten from a tree. They used to call me Roy. I came here seeking a vision, to find out how to find what I have lost. May I serve you in any way to repay your hospitality?”

The goddess-princess of the mountain, Tamalpais, softened a bit.

Tamalpais tilted her head, considering him. The wind stirred her long, dark hair, making it ripple like water in the moonlight. Her eyes, sharp as a hawk's, took his measure.

“You speak well for an old man,” she said at last. “And with humility--rare in those who call themselves heroes.”

The Old Hero--Roy, as he had once been called--straightened from his bow but kept his eyes respectfully lowered. He had stood before kings, wizards, and warlords in his youth, but before Tamalpais, he felt as if he stood before something older, wilder, beyond the reach of time.

She studied him a moment longer, then nodded. “Very well. You seek a vision? Then I shall give you one.”

With a sweep of her arm, she gestured toward the vast valley below. The night air shimmered, and suddenly the landscape was different--not as it was now, but as it had been long ago. The bay was smaller, untouched by the hands of men. The forests were denser, the rivers wilder, and the mountain itself seemed taller, crowned with a golden light that pulsed like a living heart.

“Once,” she said, “this land was whole. The people here lived in harmony with it, understanding that all things are bound together. But time unraveled that knowledge. Cities rose, forests fell, and men forgot the language of the earth. Even heroes forgot.” She turned her gaze back to him. “Tell me, Roy, what is it that you have lost?”

He swallowed. The question struck deeper than he expected. What have I lost?

He had thought it was his purpose, or perhaps his youth. But standing before her, with the old world spread out in spectral light before him, he wondered--had he lost something even greater? Something he had never even known he possessed?

“I don't know,” he admitted. “Not yet.”

Tamalpais gave a small, knowing smile. “Then that is your quest.” She stepped closer, and when she spoke again, her voice was softer, almost kind. “I will give you three gifts to help you on your way. But you must earn them.”

He straightened, the old instinct of adventure stirring in his bones. “Tell me how.”

Tamalpais reached into the folds of her cloak and pulled out a small bundle wrapped in black silk. “The first gift is a question. Find the answer, and you shall receive the second.”

She handed it to him. He took it carefully, unwrapping it to reveal a single feather--black as midnight, but tipped with gold.

Roy looked up, puzzled. “What is the question?”

The princess smiled. “That, too, is yours to find.”

And with that, she turned and walked away, fading into the wind.
Chapter Six: The Answer is Love

Roy waited for the sun to rise, cradling the gold-tipped feather in his weathered hands. The mountain air was sharp with the scent of stone and pine, and the horizon slowly shifted from violet to gold. He pondered Tamalpais' words, turning them over like a riddle. Surely, she had meant for him to solve her puzzle. And if he did, he would not only answer for himself but serve Her--a thought that filled him with reverence.

The feather must be a writing instrument, he reasoned. So the question was--what was written? His first instinct was to seek knowledge, to descend the mountain and search for answers in books and scrolls. Perhaps a library would hold some forgotten legend of Tamalpais. But no--the answer had to be simpler than that. She had already shown him everything he needed to know.

The vision.

Mankind had forgotten their love of the land, lost their connection to it. He, too, had been blind--swinging his sword, fighting battles, never pausing to consider the world beneath his feet. He had spent his life slaying dragons, but had he ever truly protected anything?

The answer struck him like a bolt of lightning.

Love.

That was the word the feather was meant to write. That was what he had lost. Not just the love of the land, but love itself. Love for the world, love for life, love for others.

With a sudden surge of clarity, Roy leapt to his feet, his heart thundering in his chest. He threw out his arms and shouted to the heavens, his voice carrying down the slopes:

“The answer is Love, Your Highness!”

Then, overcome with gratitude, he bowed low and pressed his lips to the cold stone where she had stood.

In the stillness that followed, he heard her voice--not from the wind, nor from the echoes of the valley, but from within his own heart.

“Well done, Roy. Your second gift is food and water for your journey, and the third gift is an elixir to restore some of your youth--just enough for you to find love again and raise a family, if you like.”

Before the lingering silence could settle, his heart stirred with another truth, spoken in the soft, commanding tone of Tamalpais herself:

“Roy, you left your Great Hall not by chance, but because I called to you across the tapestry of time. You stepped through a doorway from your ancient realm into my mountain--a passage that has since vanished. In this new land, I have granted you the power to understand and speak its tongue, English, so that you might engage fully with its people and secrets. Know that the portal you once crossed will never reappear; your absence went unnoticed, and fate would have claimed you soon after, unlamented and forgotten. Yet here you stand, gifted with a future unburdened by what has been lost.”

Then, like the whisper of wings, he felt the softest touch on his cheek.

When he opened his eyes, he was alone. The sun had risen, gilding the peaks with light. Before him, neatly placed on a flat stone, sat a small leather waterskin, a bundle wrapped in cloth, and a vial of liquid that shimmered like the dawn.

Roy took a deep breath, filling his lungs with the crisp morning air. He was no longer just an old hero. He was a man with a future.

He smiled, took up his gifts, and began his descent.

Professor Clara Dearheart


Chapter One: The Descent

The mountain air was sharp and clean, carrying the scent of pine and damp earth. Roy made his way down the rocky slopes, his boots crunching over gravel and roots, his breath steady but laced with uncertainty. He had been here before--on mountains, after visions, searching for meaning--but something felt different now.

A few miles from the peak, he found a quiet place to rest. A circle of redwoods, ancient and still, surrounded a patch of soft grass. He sat cross-legged, placing the small leather waterskin, the cloth-wrapped bundle, and the shimmering vial before him like sacred offerings.

It was possible, he reasoned, that everything he had experienced--Tamalpais, the vision, the feather, the gifts--had been a fevered hallucination. Wine and moldy rye bread were poor rations, even for an old warrior. He ran a hand through his unkempt hair, grimacing. Maybe it was time to give up booze. And questionable bread. And, while he was making oaths, perhaps he should finally retire from beast-slaying and princess-debauching. He had spent a lifetime seeking glory and pleasure--perhaps it was time to seek something higher.

His fingers brushed the vial.

The liquid within shimmered like dawnlight on water.

Tamalpais had called it a gift. An elixir to restore his youth, to heal his body, to prepare him for what was to come.

If she was real.

If it wasn't just his own desperate mind, trying to make meaning from the scraps of a broken past.

He exhaled, long and slow. The wind stirred the branches overhead, whispering secrets only the trees understood.

A test, then.

He uncorked the vial and drank.
The taste was like cool spring water, but richer, deeper, suffused with something he had no words for--golden warmth, a pulse of vitality, the hum of a song he had forgotten.
It began immediately.

Heat spread through his chest, his limbs, his skull. His heart pounded, but not with pain--with power. His bones, worn by time, cracked and realigned. Old wounds, the hidden aches he had carried for decades, melted away. His vision sharpened, his senses expanded--he could hear the rush of sap in the trees, the distant crash of waves beyond the hills, the heartbeat of the land itself.

And his mind--

For the first time in years, his mind was clear. The fog of regret, the weight of past failures, the dull ache of time wasted--they were gone. In their place was something clean, something pure.

He was still Roy. But he was also something new.

He stood, rolling his shoulders, flexing his hands.

A laugh rose in his chest--deep, unburdened, filled with the wild joy of being alive.

The world awaited.

But first, he needed a plan.

And, perhaps, breakfast.

He slung the waterskin over his shoulder, took up the bundle, and started down the mountain--toward the unknown, toward civilization, toward whatever lay ahead.

The Return had begun.



Chapter Two: A Strange Alliance

Professor Clara Dearheart stepped off her commuter bus into the early dusk, the remnants of the day's lectures still echoing in her mind. As she walked past a row of flickering streetlamps near the tavern, a group of drunks began to follow her with leering intent. Their crude remarks escalated quickly--until one man snatched her purse and another yanked her arm, pulling her toward a shadowed clump of bushes.

A sharp, panicked cry escaped her lips just as a crow cawed from above, “Hey dumb-dumb! Better hurry! Professor Dearheart is in trouble!” Somewhere near downtown, Roy caught the crow's warning and burst into action. Racing through the streets, he arrived just in time to see one thug tugging at her blouse.

“Get off her!” he commanded.

The drunks laughed and brandished their tiny four-inch switchblades with mock menace. Roy only smiled. In three swift, precise seconds, they lay unconscious at his feet, their blades clattering harmlessly on the pavement.

Roy knelt beside the professor. “Are you all right?” he asked gently.

Clara's eyes widened, and she recoiled, her expression torn between gratitude and fear. “Yes… thank you,” she stammered, still uncertain whether to be more afraid of the stranger or the now-slumbering assailants.

Noticing her distress, Roy refrained from any thought of personal gain. Instead of rifling through the drunks' pockets, he allowed them to lie undisturbed. Sensing the unresolved tension, Clara hesitated, then spoke with a cautious firmness.

“You shouldn't be out here alone after something like this,” she said. “Come with me--I live not far from here. It would be best if you got home safely.”

A flicker of amusement softened Roy's rugged features. “I suppose a warm meal and a safe place are in order,” he replied.

Thus, the unlikely pair began walking down the dimly lit lane, the city's night wrapping around them. As they disappeared into the quieter streets, an unspoken understanding formed--a subtle, shared promise that in this strange new world, they might find solace and purpose together.

Chapter Three: The Stray and the Seer

As they walked up the path through the yard to Clara's front door, she tightened her grip on Roy's hand and looked up at him, her breath catching. She had always been sensitive to energy, but his aura was like nothing she had ever seen--pure gold, a radiance so strong it was nearly blinding. He moved like a great cat, all grace and lethal precision, yet his presence felt undeniably right, as if he had been placed in her path by fate itself.

And fate had never sent her anything she wasn't meant to keep.

Every psychic within a thousand miles must be tuning in to this moment, she mused. Something big had just shifted.

At the door, she turned to him, unable to contain the sheer joy bubbling up inside her. She gave him a smile with no no in it--an invitation, a promise, a certainty. Then, without warning, she leaned in and stole a kiss, her lips warm and teasing against his.

Roy froze for half a heartbeat, then let out a low, delighted laugh. She was bold. He liked that.

Case closed. He was in love.

Inside, Clara made an executive decision. “You can hang your cloak by the door,” she instructed, stepping inside and flicking on the light. “I'll run you a hot bath and make us tea.” She tossed a wink over her shoulder. “Throw your dirty clothes in the machine here, love. And then,” she added, her voice dipping with mischief, “you can help me soap my back.”

Roy exhaled slowly, as if the weight of centuries had just slipped from his shoulders.

She was beautiful, standing there with that knowing smile, her blue eyes full of amusement and something softer, deeper. Her heart-shaped face, framed by golden hair, was the kind of beauty poets sang of, but it was the calm strength in her that truly held him spellbound. She was tall, strong, and unmistakably feminine, a woman who knew her own mind.

Roy met her gaze and saw his future.

And for the first time in longer than he could remember, he felt at home.

(For discretion, we leave the rest of this chapter to the reader's imagination.)

Chapter Four: The Sword and the Vow

The next morning, when Clara woke, Roy was watching her with an expression of quiet wonder.

“What's for breakfast, Dearheart?” he asked, his voice warm with affection.

Without warning, Clara pounced on him, straddling him cowgirl-style, her golden hair tumbling over her shoulders as she grinned mischievously. “You are, cowboy! Yeehaw!” she shrieked, bouncing playfully.

Then she paused, tilting her head in sudden realization. “Wait a minute… how did you know my name? I never told you.”

Roy moved with the swiftness of a striking panther, flipping their positions in an instant. He had her pinned beneath him, but his grip was gentle, teasing. He leaned down, his emerald eyes dancing.

“A crow told me,” he murmured. “He cawed, 'Professor Dearheart is in trouble!' So I came running.”

Clara narrowed her eyes. “Humpf! A likely story.”

Roy only grinned, unrepentant.

“And what shall I call you, cowboy?” she continued. “My first name is Clara. And more importantly, when are you going to make me an honest woman and marry me?”

Roy's smile softened. “They used to call me Roy, and I will do it instantly, my love,” he vowed. “Just let me fetch my sword, and we shall jump over it three times while holding hands. That is the way of my people.”

“Sword?” Clara blinked. He was a bit odd. But odd or not, she had already decided she was keeping him. “Fine. Go get it, Roy!”

And so he did.

They performed the ancient ritual in her living room, hands clasped, hearts light, leaping together over the gleaming blade.

And to make a long story short--while maintaining discretion--let's simply say that the newly married couple spent the rest of the day thoroughly enjoying their honeymoon, wrapped in tangled sheets and whispered laughter, getting much better acquainted.

By evening, they made a resolution.

Tomorrow, Sunday, they would drive up the mountain together.

It was time for Clara to meet the mysterious other woman in Roy's life--the reclusive Indian ghost goddess-princess, Tamalpais.



Chapter Five: The Peak of Promise

Before dawn, the landscape was a canvas of hushed grays and muted blues as Roy and Clara ascended the final, rugged miles to the summit of Mt. Tamalpais. Each footstep stirred ancient dust and whispered secrets of a world both lost and reborn. The cool air carried the quiet promise of a new day--a day when the old magic might yet shine again.

At the summit, just as the first faint blush of sunrise began to tint the horizon, they found her waiting. There, amid the stillness and the gathering light, stood Tamalpais--the mountain's eternal guardian. Her presence was at once formidable and tender, a living embodiment of nature's mystique. Dark hair cascaded like a veil of midnight, and her eyes sparkled with the ageless wisdom of the peaks.

Roy immediately bowed, his reverence evident as he spoke. “Great Tamalpais, I present to you my beloved wife, Clara Dearheart. We have come seeking your guidance and pledging our service to the path that lies ahead.”

A serene smile curved Tamalpais's lips as she regarded the couple. “Roy, Clara,” she intoned, her voice echoing like wind over stone, “know this: the dragons you once battled have long been vanquished. The true adversary now is not a beast of fire and scale, but the quiet, pervasive evil that festers in hearts and in forgotten corners of our world.”

Roy's eyes shone with both determination and wonder. “Then tell us, how are we to combat such darkness?”

With a measured grace, Tamalpais replied, “You must wield wisdom and strength--not solely through the art of the sword but through the enduring power of love. Engage in a spiritual war, a battle of light against shadow. Spread love, nurture life, and let your legacy be one of hope and renewal. And yes, bear children, for in their laughter and light, the future is reborn.”

Before the echo of her words could fully settle, Clara interjected, her voice laced with pragmatic concern. “But Tamalpais, there is a danger here on earth as well. Roy has no documents to prove his identity, and I fear the government's ever-watchful eye may soon be upon him.”

Tamalpais's eyes twinkled with gentle amusement. “Ah, dear Clara, do not fret. Remember the gold-tipped black feather that has accompanied Roy on his journey? That simple token holds more power than it seems--it can be used to fill out any form, to validate any claim. Its magic ensures that bureaucratic barriers crumble before the authenticity of your spirit.”

Clara's worry gave way to a smile of astonished relief. “So a little old magic can outsmart even the sternest of modern institutions?”

“Indeed,” the mountain goddess replied softly. “Trust in the ancient ways, for they are as enduring as the earth itself.”

As the sun broke fully over the horizon, bathing the peak in a cascade of golden light, Roy and Clara exchanged a final, respectful glance with Tamalpais. “Thank you, wise guardian,” Roy intoned. “Your words will be our compass as we return to the realm of men.”

“Go forth with love in your hearts and courage in your step,” Tamalpais blessed them, “and let your journey kindle light in a world shadowed by doubt and despair. The magic you carry will be your shield and your guide.”

With that, the sacred meeting concluded. Roy and Clara began their descent, the soft morning light guiding their way down the ancient paths. The mountain--steadfast and eternal--watched over them as a silent witness to their covenant.

As the familiar trails of civilization reappeared, the couple's conversation took on a lighter, more earthly tone. “Roy,” Clara said with a playful lilt as they ambled along, “now that we've secured our passage with a magical feather, I think it's high time we update your wardrobe. Those old clothes have seen too many battles.”

Roy chuckled, his eyes dancing with a secret glimmer. “Perhaps I might even conjure enough gold to buy the finest garments of the modern age,” he mused, a thoughtful pause betraying an unspoken possibility.

Clara arched an eyebrow in teasing disbelief. “Conjure gold, you say? Now that would be a spectacle indeed. But until then, we'll let the feather work its wonders.”

Their laughter mingled with the rustle of leaves and the gentle murmur of the awakening city below. In that moment, the grandeur of ancient magic met the intimacy of everyday life--a delicate balance of myth and mundane that would define the new chapter of their existence.

Hand in hand, they stepped forward into a future that shimmered with promise--a future where battles were fought not with steel alone, but with the indomitable power of love and the quiet magic of belief. Though they had bid farewell to Tamalpais, her blessing lingered like a soft echo in their hearts, urging them onward into a world both familiar and forever changed.

And as they disappeared down the mountain path, the promise of further adventures--of secret magics yet undiscovered and destinies still unfolding--whispered on the wind. Their return to civilization was not an end, but the turning of a new page, where old legends and fresh dreams converged in the light of a new dawn.

Tamalpais


Chapter One: George at the Door


The porch light caught a pair of green eyes waiting for them at Clara's Mill Valley house. A striped brown tabby sat squarely on the mat, as though she had been guarding the door all along.

Clara slowed. The cat didn't budge--only cocked an ear and gave a flick of her tail, as if to say: Well? I've been waiting.

Roy raised his hands to his head, pantomiming cat ears and mimicking her posture. He tilted one ear dramatically, a foolish grin tugging at his mouth. “Mrraio?” he asked, attempting fluent Catspeak.

“Mrao,” the tabby replied, low and steady, eyes locking on his. The sound went through him like a tuning fork struck on bone.

Roy's chest tightened. “She says her name is George,” he translated softly, suddenly serious. “She's ours. And unless she's fed immediately, she'll perish on the spot.”

Clara burst out laughing, her hair catching fire in the last light as she scooped the cat into her arms. “George? That's ridiculous. And perfect.”

George pressed her head beneath Clara's chin and purred so hard Clara felt it in her collarbone. Clara closed her eyes, surprised at the rush of tenderness. It felt like being claimed.

Roy blinked at them, dazed. “She also insists she'll be an excellent guard cat and--uh--nanny for the twins. Wait. What twins!?”

Clara hugged the purring cat tighter, ignoring him.

Roy looked from the woman he loved to the cat who had chosen them, and his grin softened into something deeper. “She's more than she seems,” he murmured, and for once he wasn't joking.

In a nearby tree, a crow spoke, "Caw caw caw, caw!" (This is my tree, and everything that can be seen is mine.)

It flew off.



Chapter Two: The Nap Interrupted


They tromped into the big, homey kitchen--redwood paneling glowing warmly, tiles cool underfoot, a broad oak table waiting like an old friend.

Clara set the cat on the table and pointed at the flap in the back door. “This is the doggy door,” she said with mock sternness. “For going outside. Not for mischief.” She flicked the flap with her wrist.

George flicked her tail--we'll see--then leapt down just in time for Clara to crack open a can of albacore. She devoured it with gusto, each bite punctuated by throaty little grunts of satisfaction.

“I'll make brunch, then we can have a Sunday nap,” Clara said, winking. “Daddy, maybe set three places?”

Brunch unfolded in glorious excess: scrambled eggs with cheddar, thick buttered sourdough, strawberries drowning in cream. George, astonishingly polite now, sat upright in her chair, nibbling daintily while Roy and Clara devoured theirs like castaways ashore.

Afterward, Clara tugged Roy toward the bedroom with mock solemnity. “Adult nap. Come along.” She tossed a glance over her shoulder. “Behave, cat.”

The door clicked. Muffled laughter, rustle of sheets.

Then--crash!

Clara, bare as sunlight, strode into the living room. George crouched beside a toppled glass vial--the elixir Tamalpais had entrusted to Roy. The stopper rolled loose, contents gone but for a single shining drop. George's tongue flicked. Gone.

The change was instant. Fur rippled, body stretching like storm-tossed water. In heartbeats she stood bobcat-sized--still tabby, still white-bellied, but her eyes blazed emerald.

Roy stumbled in, awestruck. “Oh, you are a bad kitty,” he whispered.

Clara only smiled wider. She leaned into him, laughter low, voice a purr. “So… you like cats?”

Her lips brushed his cheek, then her tongue flicked playfully. He sputtered laughter. They tumbled back to bed, wrestling with wild joy.

This time the door stayed open. George gave them one disdainful look, sat primly, and began to wash with the air of a queen whose subjects had gone feral. “Apes,” she muttered, though her rumbling purr betrayed contentment.

At last she padded over, curled into Clara's arm, and drifted into dreams with them.



Chapter Three: Dr. Amos Fox


Clara woke with a start. “Ruh roh.” In her dream she had seen an evil red orb, distant yet focused on her house. Evil was near--closing fast.

“Roy! Grab your things and the cat. Ten seconds. Meet me at the car--we'll dress on the way!”

Roy didn't argue. He swept George under one arm, snatched clothes, cloak, sword, feather from Tamalpais, and bolted.

Clara grabbed her go-bag, shoes, keys, phone. She hesitated over panties. “Commando it is,” she muttered, and sprinted.

By the time Roy and George tumbled into the car, Clara had the engine snarling. Tires squealed as they tore uphill.

“Buckle up,” Clara said calmly. “We're going to see Dr. Amos Fox. My godfather.”

George pressed her nose to the glass, tail swishing to the beat of “Badass Woman Driving.” Roy just held on, dazzled and alarmed.

Minutes later they coasted to a halt at wrought-iron gates. They opened silently, as if recognizing her. Gravel crackled beneath the tires as redwoods closed in.

At the end of the path stood a tall, lean man--silver hair, ageless face, eyes clear as spring water. His smile was unhurried, already forgiving them for being late to a destiny none had asked for.

Beside him sat a poised Border Collie, tail sweeping, gaze sharp. She studied Roy, Clara, George… then locked eyes with the giant tabby. George stared back, unblinking, calculating odds.

“Clara,” the man said warmly, like kin returned. “And this must be Roy.” He bowed, Buddhist-style.

Before they could answer, thunder rolled. Smoke rose from the direction of Clara's house.



Chapter Four: This Means War

“Why don't you kids get dressed and wait in my Land Cruiser,” Fox suggested. “Leave your car keys and phones under the seat. Wipe off Roy's prints. We may come back. Or not.”

He strode inside with Ruby padding at his heels. A few minutes later, an encrypted Telegram message flew to his old Hell's Angel friend, Bear. Fox slung his medical bag over his shoulder, whistled Ruby close, and strolled into the garage humming "Black Magic Woman".

The Land Cruiser rolled out--leaving yesterday's trouble, heading straight into tomorrow's.

Fox cut Roy a sidelong glance. “So. A little bird says you need to see Tamalpais again. What's she stirred up this time?”

Clara smirked. “Trouble? Try fun. In two days I've married a warrior-king, adopted a giant smart-aleck cat, gotten pregnant with twins, lost my house in a mysterious explosion, and become wanted by every agency from ICE to the FBI--including Animal Control. Oh, and I'm not wearing underwear."

Fox stroked his beard, eyes twinkling. “Well. Sounds like you've got it under control.”

Ruby thrust her nose between the seats, sharp bark. (It's the cat's fault.)

George swatted her muzzle, claws sheathed. “Mrao.” (Nonsense, doggo.)

“Cut it out!” Clara snapped. Then, “Godfather--you've met Tamalpais?”

Fox chuckled. “Since the '60s. Dead concert. She takes holidays, you know.  Incognito. She loves Santana. He wrote her a song. Knows every crow in the Bay, they keep her briefed. She's bitter about how it all turned out--Kesey, Garcia, Viet Nam, RFK, LBJ. Flower Power fizzled, country went to hell.”

He fell quiet. Oddly sheepish. Clara caught it--was he blushing? That sly old fox…

Fox cleared his throat. “So, Roy--how do you plan to support my god-daughter and the twins?”

Roy muttered, “Why does everyone--human, animal, divine--know she's pregnant before I do?”

Clara kissed him. “My love, I meant to tell you. We've been busy. And yes--George is psychic, and the crows gossip.”

The Cruiser climbed toward the summit. And waiting in the lot was Tamalpais in her tall-woman form--raven-black hair bound with a headband, buckskin dress clashing with green combat boots and streaked warpaint. Bow on her back, tomahawk at her hip, Colt .45 on her belt. She was packing heat--and a whole lot of attitude.



Chapter Five: Tamalpais

“The Evil One of Mt. Diablo has found a human Vessel,” Tamalpais said, voice low and flint-edged. “The Bay and beyond will burn unless we strike first. Clara's house was only the opening shot."

“We'll meet Fox's ally, Bear, then I'll give you the battle plan.”

Tamalpais looked every inch the terrifying ancient ghost-goddess-princess--but in the flesh, tangible, solid. And surprisingly hot, considering her age.

She slipped into the back beside Clara, George, and Ruby. “Hello, Amos. You look well.”

“Thank you, Your Highness. And you look… fantastically terrifying today.” Fox studied her in the rear-view.

Clara listened, half-horrified, half-delighted. Imagine! Her eighty-year-old, ex-hippie godfather making a move on a million-year-old witch goddess. Brave man.

“George," she commanded. "Go sit on  Roy's lap. Give Tamalpais some room.”

The massive cat sprawled across Roy with a grunt. She grinned. “Godfather, why don't I drive? You and Her Excellency can… strategize.” Smirk.

They switched seats. Clara rolled the Cruiser forward.

Tamalpais leaned close to Fox. “We may be killed tonight. Or maimed, disfigured, cast into the abyss.”

“Don't tease,” he said dryly.

She arched one eyebrow, pure Morticia Addams. “We've a long night ahead, Amos--perhaps our last. Time for a sip of my elixir?”

She produced a vial, half full of glowing liquid. One wave of her hand, and it brimmed over. Chuckling, she passed it to him. “Buckle up.”

Fox drank. It was like spring water spiked with honey and lightning. Fire raced through his body. His heart pounded, his skin flushed, and years melted away. He looked forty, felt sixteen. He turned to Tamalpais like a starving man eyeing fresh cherry pie.

She smiled sweetly. “First, we slay the ancient evil of Mt. Diablo and its human Vessel."

Clara, steering with one hand, closed her jaw with the other. “Unbelievable.”

Roy struggled under George's thirty pounds, then surrendered with a sigh. He caught Clara's eye. “To battle.”

A shadow swept across the sun. George bristled, fur on end. “Mrroaow!” (Step on it, Blondie!)



Chapter Six: Bear

As they descended the mountain, Roy sat in silence, wrestling with the strangeness of it all. He'd only been in this world a handful of days, yet already he'd found love, clan, and purpose. And now--called again to slay beasts.

So be it. Every land needs strong men with sharp blades. He had a family now. If his job was to clear the monsters from their path--then that was his lot, and he'd not shrink from it.

He glanced at Clara behind the wheel. She radiated delight, as if she'd been waiting her whole life for this wild ride. Roy felt blood hammer in his temples and a reckless grin tug at his mouth. A man could do worse than fight for such a woman.

Fox directed her past the public library. On the curb, a hulking man in a worn leather vest swung up into his Ford F-250 Super Duty--six seats, lift kit, enough torque to haul a tank. He fell in behind them without a word.

At a quiet lot the two vehicles nosed together. Clara killed the Land Cruiser's engine, tossed the keys under the seat, and stepped out. “Too hot to keep,” Fox muttered. “It's tied to me.”

Bear climbed down from the truck, massive and solid, with the rolling walk of a man who'd fought both fists and wars--and usually won.

“Evenin',” he rumbled. “How 'bout we swing by the Depot--coffee, cake, and a bathroom break? Long night ahead.”

Fox nodded. “We'll need fuel.”

It was nearly six, with hours yet before their midnight rendezvous at Diablo. Enough time to regroup, and not much more.

In the parking lot behind the café, Tamalpais took command. She didn't raise her voice; she didn't need to. “Set up your conference, Bear. Call in your chiefs.”

Bear tapped his phone. Within minutes the speakers in his truck crackled alive, a dozen rough voices patched in from across the Bay Area.

The goddess stood like a general before her army, backlit by the orange glow of sunset. When she spoke, it was flint and thunder: the ancient evil rising, the vessel it had chosen, the battle to come.

When she finished, silence. Even bikers know when there's nothing left to say.

“Bear,” she said, turning to him at last. “Drink.”

She pressed a vial into his hand. He sniffed it, shrugged, and knocked it back like a shot of bourbon.

The effect was immediate. Before their eyes, the sagging belly shrank, the bald crown sprouted dark hair, the stooped shoulders straightened. He flexed a hand, astonished, then grinned like a man who'd been given back his twenties.

“Whoo-eee!” Bear bellowed. “That's the good stuff!”

Tamalpais allowed herself the faintest smile. “Understatement.”

She clapped once, sharply. “Enough chatter. We move. Obey the laws. No sudden speeds, no heroics. The police must not learn that World War Three begins tonight.”

And just like that, the clan rolled out--one roaring Super Duty, two animals, a goddess, and the handful of mortals mad enough to ride with her.



Chapter Seven: Second Thoughts

The Ford's big diesel hummed steadily as it rolled east across the darkening Bay. No one spoke. Gravel-throated silence, thick as smoke, filled the cab.

Finally Tamalpais shifted in her seat. Her voice cut the quiet like a scalpel.

“Friends, there is still time to turn back. This may be a suicide run, and I won't lie--I feel guilty for dragging you along. If any of you want out, just say so. Step from this truck, thumb a ride, start a new life. Forget me--or remember me with a toast someday. Either way, you live. I can do this alone.”

Roy straightened, but she raised a hand, forestalling him.

“And don't make me into something I'm not. I am no goddess. No witch, black or white. No ghost. Yes, I have a princess's sense of entitlement--but I'm not royalty. I don't cast spells. I con rubes. I bluff. That's all.”

Silence deepened. You could hear the engine ticking over, the tires swishing on asphalt.

Tamalpais went on, fierce and relentless now:

“Look hard at yourselves. Are you sane? Or did someone spike your orange juice with LSD? Roy and Bear are the only ones who know fighting from the inside. The rest of you--are you even sure which end of a blade is which? We're not on our way to a Sunday school picnic. People are going to die tonight. Maybe you. Maybe me. Maybe all of us. Or maybe we rot in prison.

“And who the hell appointed you World-Savers? Who anointed you martyrs?”

Bear grunted low, but didn't interrupt.

“I'll tell you what I really am,” she said. “Just a very old woman. A Highlander without the lightning show--older than dirt, maybe older than the idea of dirt. I can't remember being a child. My best trick? Persuasion. I talk, people do what I want. My second best? Illusion. I convince you not to believe your own eyes. Those are my 'powers.' Call it psychology with a knife in its boot. I could run for President tomorrow and win by a landslide.”

She took a breath, her eyes far away. “Yes, I can Vanquish. Yes, I can Shapeshift, and put mortals to sleep. That much is real. But those are skills, sharpened across millennia, not fairy dust. Roy's portal, the elixir? Science that you don't understand, not magic. But when you get killed, I can't un-kill you. When you cry, I can't un-cry your tears.”

She leaned toward the window latch. “Stop this truck. I'll go the rest of the way as a crow. I'll face the Evil One myself. That way your blood isn't on my hands.”

Everyone spoke at once, a jumble of voices--denial, anger, loyalty, even laughter, all tangled together.

Then Fox, quiet until now, said flatly:

“We love you. Whither thou goest, we go.”



Chapter Eight: Rendezvous

The F-250 Super Duty carried Tamalpais and her improbable war-band--warriors, pranksters, mommies, and talkative animals--up to the North Gate of Mt. Diablo. It was 2330. A flick of her hand put the gatekeepers to sleep, another gesture Vanquished the lock. The truck rumbled through, climbing deeper into the mountain's dark folds.

They stopped at a turnout to wait. The main army--the thousand Hell's Angels already scattered across the Bay--was busy keeping the cops and Feds chasing shadows: bonfires on bridges, fistfights in bars, traffic accidents staged with theatrical precision. Only thirty-six had been chosen for the mountain itself.

Right on the stroke of midnight, they arrived. Not roaring but whispering, throttles low, bikes rolling like ghosts.

Bear climbed down from the cab and opened a wooden crate glowing faintly from within. His voice carried:

“Her Excellency, Tamalpais, requests that you drink of her elixir before battle. It'll put fire in your blood and steel in your bones.”

The vials passed from hand to hand. One by one the Angels drank, eyes widening as youth and strength surged back through worn bodies.

“After victory,” Bear promised, “you'll come to her mountain in three days to collect your rewards. For now--half of you lead our truck to the summit lot. The rest, hold back as reserve. Stay mounted; we may need a fast extraction.”

Engines murmured assent. The column moved out, winding upward through switchbacks toward the peak.

Tamalpais unfolded wings of shadow and was gone into the night--snuffing cameras, blanking witnesses, recruiting her bird-folk. Crows would cover her like a living stormcloud; Hawks and Eagles held in reserve. The Bluejays, incorrigible blabbermouths, were told there was a kegger waiting at the top.

Dawn touched the sky when Bear braked the truck in the summit lot. He fixed his phone to the dash, camera pointed at the open ground.

“Clara--driver's seat. Keep her idling. And whatever happens, keep George, Ruby, and Fox safe inside. Like babes in cribs, hear me?”

He swung out, Roy at his side, Angels fanning into formation.



Chapter Nine: Showdown

At the far end of the asphalt stood the Vessel of the Evil One, grinning with manic delight. His voice was acid sugar:

“Welcome, travelers. Are you here for the keg party? Or to Worship Me, and kneel forever?”

Crows circled overhead, a tightening gyre of black wings.

Roy drew his sword, voice ringing like steel.

“Neither, Putrid Pustulence of Satan's buttocks! We invite you to return to your foul kennel in the bowels of earth.”

The Vessel sneered. “And if I refuse?”

The crows dipped lower, shadows dragging across asphalt.

“Then we'll cut you, stomp you, slice you,” Roy promised. “And we'll recite Vogon poetry until your ears bleed.”

The Evil One spread his arms. “Then die.”

He raised his power--only to feel a whisper at his back. Tamalpais had landed silently.

“Not today, bro,” she said flat.

Her bow thrummed. The broadhead took him through the mouth, arrow jutting from his neck. The Vessel gurgled, clawing at the shaft. Tamalpais raised her hands for a Vanquishing--

--but his fury lashed out first. A psychic blow, gorilla-swing with a bat, hurled her down. She hit the tarmac like a sack of potatoes and lay still.

The lot detonated. Roy and Bear roared and charged, their madness contagious; the thirty-six Angels with them dropped all pretense of humanity, howling like berserkers. The crows fell upon the Vessel, wings and beaks a storm. Hawks and Eagles stooped from the clouds like spears. Even George and Ruby tumbled from the truck window, fur and fangs flashing.

The Vessel turned in circles, flailing, every swing another psychic hammer. Men staggered. Birds dropped, broken. Angels bled but kept clawing forward. And still the Evil One stood, coughing, choking, and yet--unbowed.

When silence finally fell, he alone remained on his feet. Bloody, but upright. Victorious.

He turned toward Tamalpais's unconscious body, lips shaping promises of torment unspeakable--

--and heard the last thing he expected: a diesel engine at full bore.

The F-250 came out of nowhere, four tons of steel fury. It hit him square. Flesh and bone went airborne. He landed broken, one eye rolling toward Tamalpais.

She stirred. With the calm of inevitability, she raised a hand, extended a single finger, and spoke the word.

The Vanquishing was absolute. Vessel and Master both winked out like a candle flame.

“Bye now,” she whispered--before collapsing into darkness herself.



Chapter Ten: Aftermath

The battlefield was strewn with groaning Angels, bloodied birds, and smoking asphalt. But all who had drunk the elixir stirred and healed--flesh knitting, bones realigning.

All but three. Tamalpais lay white as marble. George and Ruby, still breathing, but dim.

Fox knelt by her. Quick exam, quick conclusion: concussion at least, maybe worse. He looked at Bear, desperation raw.

“Load her. We've got to move.”

He scooped her up like a child and sprinted to the truck. Bear swung behind the wheel. George and Ruby were lifted to the cab, while Roy and Clara clung to choppers' "bitch seats" as the strike team rolled downhill in ragged formation.

Fox cradled Tamalpais in the back, her head on his lap. Her breath shallow, her face too still.

“We need her conscious,” he muttered. “We need her to Jedi-wave us past the cops.”

“Any more elixir?” he demanded.

“Not a drop,” Bear said grimly.

Fox thought fast, then reckless. “Maybe there's a trace in me.” He bent and kissed her--slow, lingering, a gambler's last bet.

For a heartbeat, nothing. Then her eyes opened, green fire flaring.

“You frightened me,” she accused softly. “Do it again.”

“Okay, Morticia,” he grinned, relief cracking into laughter.

The truck barreled down the mountain, bikers flanking, the crows above forming a ragged escort. Behind them, a thousand Angels still lit the Bay on fire, keeping the road clear.

The war wasn't over. But the Evil One was gone, at least for now.

The End (for now!)
